  options:
    - ["8:00", 1, 1] #1s as placeholder for now (HA editor freaks out otherwise)
    - ["10:00", 1, 1]
    - ["16:00", 1, 1]
    - ["20:00", 1, 1]
    
#TODO:
# - get information from current Hue setup about temperature (the goal for now is to synchronise with current Hue as it works well for me)
# - create automation that
# triggers on state(input_select)[0],
# changes temperature (turn on, startup temperature and changing input_value for the switch) on [1]
# changes brightness (in similar manner to temperature) on [2]
# - verify color scheme used for various day times
